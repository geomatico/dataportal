ICOS-Spain is a partnership aiming the implementation of a basic network of stations and institutions that will be the basis for the Spanish participation in the ICOS infrastructure. The Spanish basic network will include several stations of each of the components of the systematic observation ICOS infrastructure (Atmospheric, Ecosystems and Ocean). The implementation of the stations will be aimed by the consolidation and the improvement of existing infrastructures in Spain until reaching the standards of the ICOS systematic observation stations, not only regarding the list of variables measured but also on the measurement protocols (instrumentation, calibration, operation, QA/QC). 
ICOS-Spain partnership will articulate the necessary elements for the coordination of the different components and Spanish institutions that contribute to ICOS, including the promotion of training activities for scientific and technical young researchers. 
ICOS-Spain partnership will elaborate a strategy for the future extension of the basic network of Spanish stations, taking into consideration, not only the suitability criteria (approved by ICOS), but also the specific objectives of development of an ICOS network in Spain.
