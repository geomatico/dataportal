Tasks
=====

Only deal with integer and double variables. Create interfaces for integer and double.


Limitations
===========

The CEAM converter does not take into account the n_n_n parameters in the variable name.

No converter takes into account ancillary variables. Only a main variable and "axis" variables are stored in the file.

AEMET dataset only accepts N W latitude/longitude. If S or E is read, it fails.
